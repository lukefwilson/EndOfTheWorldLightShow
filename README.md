Steps To Run:
- plug lights into power and into computer.
- go to terminal and run `fcserver-osx default.json`. both files are included in top level of repo
- run any processing sketch that is set up for the lights.

Future:
- Set up Raspberry Pi to serve lights so Pi remains plugged into lights and all you have to do is send sketch info to the pi over the network.
